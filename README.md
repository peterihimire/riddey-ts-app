## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

A package is using react 16 while the project runs on react 18, hence a dependency conflict.
